extenstion resource does not build its own resources, now makes reuqest to server and receives buil base resources,
client css resources are given the id of the base resource.



EXTENSTION SIDE:

resoource change occurs but does not udate the nex cssText leading to firsst change being alied, and after second request changes back to original style. ( may be because of the cssRules not being updated to rflect the new changes )
( UPDATEALL )  ==>  ( ITERANDUPDATE )  ==> IMPROPER UPDATE OF CSSRULE CLIENT SIDE.



1. must check if id remains and is correctly updated after reload. 
2. check solution for dynamic css rules ( padding: 0px; padding-left 0px ====> will be in css rules padding: 0px )
2a. this leads to regex not being built properly and though the CSSSTRATEGY correctly finds the change the REGEXHELPER is not
able to find the relevant css block in the file due to the difference in cssText.
